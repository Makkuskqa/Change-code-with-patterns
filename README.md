# Change-code-with-patterns
we have one program with, difficult to perceive code, and second program with update code with patterns 
First program contains four independent classes, which allow user to login to the system in acordance to his class(user, admin or any...), then deepcopy his <login>&<password an return it 
If the user is new then function add new role class(or login and password) to the source file with checked users data
Then program allow user in acordance to his class make some functions ...


The new program have the same functions and classes but a little rewrite with logic functions or code and with class patterns
